🧠 AI-Powered SQLite Query Agent

This project integrates an LLM-powered SQL Agent with a local SQLite database. The agent interprets natural language queries, generates corresponding SQL statements, and executes them against the database. It is designed to streamline data exploration by removing the need for manual SQL writing.

🚀 Features

🔹 Natural Language → SQL: Ask questions in plain English, get valid SQL queries.

🔹 SQLite Execution: Runs queries directly against a local database.

🔹 Agent Architecture: Modular design with an Agent class to manage reasoning and execution.

🔹 Traceability: Final outputs include both the generated SQL and explanation.

🔹 Extendable: Easy to adapt for new tools, databases, or LLM backends.
